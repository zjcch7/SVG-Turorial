## Basics Of Making An Ellipse

As I have for the previous shapes, I will provide a base code for the shape. 

**< svg height="140" width="500" >
  <ellipse cx="200" cy="80" rx="100" ry="50"
  style="fill:yellow;stroke:purple;stroke-width:2" / >
< /svg >**

-**Height** and **Width** are the shapes dimensions. It kinda acts as a box moving around the shape, and it determins what parts of the shape are visible. 

-The **CX** and **CY** move the shape around the page. 

-The **RX** and **RY** determine how far the shape stretches horizontaly and verticaly.

-**FILL** is the Main color.

-**Stroke** is the color of the border.

-**Stroke-Width** is the boarders thickness.
