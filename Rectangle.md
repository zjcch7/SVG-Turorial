## Basics Of Making A Rectangle

To get you started on making your first rectangle, I have provided you with a stater code.

**< svg width="400" height="110" >
  < rect width="300" height="100" style="fill:rgb(0,0,255);stroke-width:3;stroke:rgb(600,300,0)" / >
< /svg >**

-**Width** and **Height** are the dimensions of the rectangle.

-The **style="fill:rgb(100,300,255);** and **stroke-width:3;stroke:rgb(600,300,0)** are how you control the colors. This is one of a few ways you can controle the color of your SVG image.
Using the rgb gives you a wider variety of colors to pick from by changeing the 3 number. 

-**Fill** is the main color.

-**Stroke-Width** is the border thickness.

-**Stroke** is the border color.

Play around with the numebrs, and when you get the hang of it, then save it and view it in the browser.
