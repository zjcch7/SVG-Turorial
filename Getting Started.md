### What You Will Need
Getting started in SVG is simple. All you need are the following

A text editor(I use Notepad++)
  
A browser(google)

A sense of creativity :)

Once you get your text editor open, then you are ready to get into it.
There are many diffrent shapes and atributes that you can make, but in this tutorial we will go over three.

## How To Open In Broweser

For all your SVG images. Once you have opened you text editor, go ahead and save the file as _name_.html. This will save it as a browser link.
